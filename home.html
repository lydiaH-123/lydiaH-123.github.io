    <h1>WELCOME</h1>
<p>I would like to share my story about me</p>
<br>
<p>My greatest fear is the fear of an ordinary life. 
    It’s the fear of not actually living, of my life being cut short but having never actually painted the colors my mind is full of. 
    The fear of not having stories to tell and the fear of lying in my death bed, and not having used the gift of life wisely. 
    I fear being defined by one career or by one place. People always tell you to face your fears, but I have a hard time believing that this is a fear I should set aside. 
    This is the fear that motivates me and I hope it’s here to stay</p>
